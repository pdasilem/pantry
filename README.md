# Pantry

Local note storage for coding agents. Your agent keeps notes on decisions, bugs, and context across sessions — no cloud, no API keys required, no cost.

## Features

- **Works with multiple agents** — Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Antigravity, Codex, OpenCode, RooCode. One command sets up MCP config for your agent.
- **MCP native** — Runs as an MCP server exposing `pantry_store`, `pantry_search`, and `pantry_context` as tools.
- **Local-first** — Everything stays on your machine. Notes are stored as Markdown in `~/.pantry/shelves/`, readable in Obsidian or any editor.
- **Zero idle cost** — No background processes, no daemon, no RAM overhead. The MCP server only runs when the agent starts it.
- **Hybrid search** — FTS5 keyword search works out of the box. Add Ollama, OpenAI, or OpenRouter for semantic vector search.
- **Secret redaction** — 3-layer redaction strips API keys, passwords, and credentials before anything hits disk.
- **Cross-agent** — Notes stored by one agent are searchable by all agents. One pantry, many agents.

## Install

### Download a binary (recommended)

1. Go to the [Releases](../../releases) page and download the binary for your platform:

   | Platform | File |
   |----------|------|
   | macOS (Apple Silicon) | `pantry-darwin-arm64` |
   | macOS (Intel) | `pantry-darwin-amd64` |
   | Linux x86-64 | `pantry-linux-amd64` |
   | Linux ARM64 | `pantry-linux-arm64` |
   | Windows x86-64 | `pantry-windows-amd64.exe` |

2. Make it executable and move it to your PATH (macOS/Linux):

   ```bash
   chmod +x pantry-darwin-arm64
   mv pantry-darwin-arm64 /usr/local/bin/pantry
   ```

3. On macOS you may need to allow the binary in **System Settings → Privacy & Security** the first time you run it.

### Initialize

```bash
pantry init
```

### Connect your agent

```bash
pantry setup claude-code   # or: cursor, windsurf, antigravity, codex, opencode, roocode, copilot
```

During setup (except for Windsurf), you will be prompted to install **fast context MCP servers** (`ripgrep` and `code-search`). Answering "yes" will also add these powerful context retrieval plugins to your agent's configuration.

This writes the MCP server entry into your agent's config file. Restart the agent and pantry will be available as a tool.

Run `pantry doctor` to verify everything is working.

### Tell your agent to use Pantry

MCP registration makes the tools available, but your agent also needs instructions to actually use them. The `setup` command installs a skill file automatically for agents that support it (Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Antigravity, Codex, Copilot). For other agents — or if you prefer to use a project-level rules file — add the following to your `AGENTS.md`, `.rules`, `CLAUDE.md`, or equivalent:

```markdown
## Pantry — persistent notes

You have access to a persistent note storage system via the `pantry` MCP tools.

**Session start — MANDATORY**: Before doing any work, retrieve notes from previous sessions:
- Call `pantry_context` to get recent notes for this project
- If the request relates to a specific topic, also call `pantry_search` with relevant terms

**Session end — MANDATORY**: After any task that involved changes, decisions, bugs, or learnings, call `pantry_store` with:
- `title`: short descriptive title
- `what`: what happened or was decided
- `why`: reasoning behind it
- `impact`: what changed
- `category`: one of `decision`, `pattern`, `bug`, `context`, `learning`
- `details`: full context for a future agent with no prior knowledge

Do not skip either step. Notes are how context survives across sessions.
```

## Semantic search (optional)

Keyword search (FTS5) works with no extra setup. To also enable semantic vector search, configure an embedding provider in `~/.pantry/config.yaml`:

**Ollama (local, free):**

```yaml
embedding:
  provider: ollama
  model: nomic-embed-text
  base_url: http://localhost:11434
```

Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com), then: `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`

**OpenAI:**

```yaml
embedding:
  provider: openai
  model: text-embedding-3-small
  api_key: sk-...
```

**OpenRouter:**

```yaml
embedding:
  provider: openrouter
  model: openai/text-embedding-3-small
  api_key: sk-or-...
```

**Google (Gemini API):**

```yaml
embedding:
  provider: google
  model: gemini-embedding-001
  api_key: AIzaSy...
```

After changing providers, rebuild the vector index:

```bash
pantry reindex
```

## Environment variables

All config file values can be overridden with environment variables. They take precedence over `~/.pantry/config.yaml` and are useful when the MCP host injects secrets into the environment instead of writing them to disk.

| Variable | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `PANTRY_HOME` | Override pantry home directory | `/data/pantry` |
| `PANTRY_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` | Embedding provider | `ollama`, `openai`, `openrouter`, `google` |
| `PANTRY_EMBEDDING_MODEL` | Embedding model name | `text-embedding-3-small`, `gemini-embedding-001` |
| `PANTRY_EMBEDDING_API_KEY` | API key for the embedding provider | `sk-...`, `AIzaSy...` |
| `PANTRY_EMBEDDING_BASE_URL` | Base URL for the embedding API | `http://localhost:11434` |
| `PANTRY_CONTEXT_SEMANTIC` | Semantic search mode | `auto`, `always`, `never` |

### Examples

Use OpenAI embeddings without putting the key in the config file:

```bash
PANTRY_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai \
PANTRY_EMBEDDING_MODEL=text-embedding-3-small \
PANTRY_EMBEDDING_API_KEY=sk-... \
pantry search "rate limiting"
```

Point a second pantry instance at a different directory (useful for testing or per-workspace isolation):

```bash
PANTRY_HOME=/tmp/pantry-test pantry init
PANTRY_HOME=/tmp/pantry-test pantry store -t "test note" -w "testing" -y "because"
```

Pass the API key through the MCP server config so it is injected at launch time rather than stored on disk. Example for Claude Code (`~/.claude/claude_desktop_config.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "pantry": {
      "command": "pantry",
      "args": ["mcp"],
      "env": {
        "PANTRY_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER": "openai",
        "PANTRY_EMBEDDING_MODEL": "text-embedding-3-small",
        "PANTRY_EMBEDDING_API_KEY": "sk-..."
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Disable semantic search entirely for a single invocation (falls back to FTS5 keyword search):

```bash
PANTRY_CONTEXT_SEMANTIC=never pantry search "connection pool"
```

## Under the hood

### CGO-free, pure Go

Pantry is built without CGO. SQLite runs as a WebAssembly module inside the process via [wazero](https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero) — a zero-dependency, pure-Go WASM runtime. This means:

- **No C compiler needed** — `go build` just works, no `gcc`, `musl`, or `zig` required
- **True static binaries** — the distributed binaries have no shared library dependencies (`ldd` shows nothing)
- **Cross-compilation is trivial** — all five platform targets (`GOOS`/`GOARCH`) build from a single `go build` invocation with `CGO_ENABLED=0`
- **Reproducible builds** — no C toolchain version drift

The tradeoff: first query of a session pays a one-time ~10 ms WASM compilation cost. Subsequent queries are fast.

### SQLite extensions

Two SQLite extensions are compiled into the binary as embedded WASM blobs:

**[sqlite-vec](https://github.com/asg017/sqlite-vec)** — vector similarity search. Pantry uses it to store note embeddings as 768- or 1536-dimensional `float32` vectors in a `vec0` virtual table, then retrieves the nearest neighbours with a single SQL query:

```sql
SELECT note_id, distance
FROM vec_notes
WHERE embedding MATCH ?
ORDER BY distance
LIMIT 20
```

The extension is loaded at connection open time via `sqlite3_load_extension` equivalent in the WASM host.

**FTS5** — SQLite's built-in full-text search virtual table. Notes are indexed in an `fts_notes` shadow table using the `porter` tokenizer (English stemming). FTS5 handles keyword search when no embedding provider is configured, and also runs alongside vector search as a hybrid fallback.

### Storage layout

Notes live in `~/.pantry/`:

```
~/.pantry/
  config.yaml          # embedding provider, model, API key
  pantry.db            # SQLite database (WAL mode)
  shelves/
    project/
      YYYY-MM-DD.md    # daily Markdown files — human-readable, Obsidian-compatible
```

The SQLite database holds structured note data and search indexes. The Markdown files in `shelves/` are append-only daily logs — they're the canonical human-readable view and survive even if the database is deleted (run `pantry reindex` to rebuild from them).

### GORM + vendored gormlite

The ORM layer uses [GORM](https://gorm.io) with a vendored copy of [gormlite](https://github.com/ncruces/go-sqlite3/tree/main/gormlite) — the SQLite GORM dialector from the same `ncruces/go-sqlite3` ecosystem. It's vendored (at `internal/gormlite/`) rather than imported as a module because the gormlite sub-module is versioned independently from the parent `go-sqlite3` package, and the sqlite-vec WASM binary constrains the host runtime to `go-sqlite3 v0.23.x`. Vendoring decouples dialector quality from host runtime version.

### Dependency count

The binary embeds everything it needs. Runtime dependencies: zero. The full `go.mod` direct dependency list:

| Package | Role |
|---------|------|
| `ncruces/go-sqlite3` | SQLite via WASM/wazero |
| `asg017/sqlite-vec-go-bindings` | Vector search extension (WASM blob) |
| `tetratelabs/wazero` | Pure-Go WebAssembly runtime |
| `gorm.io/gorm` | ORM |
| `modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk` | MCP server |
| `openai/openai-go` | OpenAI/OpenRouter embedding API |
| `spf13/cobra` | CLI |
| `google/uuid` | Note IDs |
| `go.yaml.in/yaml/v3` | Config parsing |
